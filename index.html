	<h1>Anyone can be a writer!</h1>
	<p>Have you ever thought of writing a book? It sounds daunting, but I assure you that you can do it. There are a few simple steps to follow to create your own story!</p>
	

	<div class="steps">
		<h2>First, decide what you want to write about</h2>
	<p>Ideas can come from any number of places. Maybe you heard someone talking at a restaurant, or you had a dream, or you were inspired by something else you read or watched. (That's a lot of 'ors', but you'll find that you'll start getting a lot of ideas. Pick one to start with.)</p>
	</div>

	<div class="steps">
		<h2>Second, start writing!</h2>
	<p>Yes, it is that simple. Find your favorite method and get to it. If you want to write on paper, then do it. If you want to use a word processor, then do that. Eventually, you'll want it digital, but worry about that later. Set a goal for your day and try to write that many words each day. If you don't make it one day, don't stress! You'll have a killer day at some point and make those words back. The key is to try to make your goal. Even on a bad day, keep writing until you have squeezed out everything you can. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="steps">
		<h2>Next, you'll want to edit. Don't do it!</h2>
	<p>While you are writing, you will want to look back at what you have already written. Leave it alone! Keep writing! There will be time for editing later, but you need a first draft to be able to edit. Get everything down and then edit.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="steps">
		<h2>Then, read as often as you can!</h2>
		<p>I said you will need to write every day and set goals for your writing. The same goes for your reading. You'll get better at writing if you read more, I promise. I used to avoid reading for fear that I would accidentally use someone else's idea. I now realize that reading more teaches me new ways of expressing an idea and makes me stronger. There is nothing wrong with being influenced by another writer. If you want to write, you have to read.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="steps">
		<h2>Finally, it is time to edit!</h2>
		<p>Congratulations, you finished your first draft. Do a little dance, buy yourself dinner, and take a few days off. Then, start reading your draft. Read the whole thing without changing a single word. After that, start making your changes. Don't be afraid to details, make grammar corrections, or change the story entirely. It is your story and you have the right to change whatever you want. Once you are finished editing, share your work with a few people and get their feed back. Use that for final edits and then your story is ready for the world!
